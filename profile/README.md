# PhD Thesis: Brandon Edwards

This Github Organization will serve as the collection of repositories that will house the data chapters (and potentially some of the other writing chapters) of my PhD thesis.

This thesis will be a manuscript-based thesis, which means it will consist of a collection of manuscripts that I have written throughout my time as a PhD student. 
Because of this, each of the chapters have already had a repository created for them under my profile, specifically for that particular manuscript. 
To compile my thesis, I will fork those repos into this organization, and modify the "article" file in each of the repositories (if one exists), such that it can be read in and compiled by the main thesis repository.

Or at least that's what I *think* I'm going to do. We will see how it works out...
